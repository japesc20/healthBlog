  // "The background in fitness and health definitely isn't exciting nor is it short, the road was long and rough among many other things. I began after highschool in 2008, I asked my best friend who was a lifting stud to show me... literally anything. We ended up lifting together for another year and half, with a lot of knowledge gained and eventually to find out a shoulder injury later. I did something very much out of character, I joined the Marine Corps",

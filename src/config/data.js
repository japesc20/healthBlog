    description: "### The Beginning Again \n\n The background in fitness and health definitely isn't exciting nor is it short, the road was long and rough among many other things. I began after highschool in 2008, I asked my best friend who was a lifting stud to show me... literally anything. \n\n We ended up lifting together for another year and half, with a lot of knowledge gained and eventually to find out a shoulder injury later. I did something very much out of character, I joined the Marine Corps. \n\n With health and fitness becoming a big part of my life, the more I grew to really enjoy it. \n\n Over the next 11 years I would be consistent and inconsistent, but never inconsistent enough to really fall out of working out... until 2020. \n\n The summer of 2020 my shoulder injury from before had finally got to a point that I could'nt perform a single pull up. \n\n I finally decided to take the longest break from lifting I'd ever done. \n\n **6 Months.** \n\n Once I began again, life started to get in the way. \n\n Covid, new job, losing new job, moving across the state. \n\n The more time spent away from the gym, the harder it became to return, at least from my experience. As Newton would say, \n\n *'A body at rest will remain at rest unless an outside force acts on it'* \n\n And that's where we begin, my journey back into health and fitness or just simply as, \n\n The Beginning... Again.",

    description: "### Welcome Everyone! \n\n Welcome to my health and fitness blog where I'll track my progress back into a healthier lifestyle. Through this I will be hoping for only a few things: \n\n * Keep myself accountable to stay on the healthier path. \n\n * Gain knowledge through trial and error, and find what best suits me with my genetics and lifestyle. \n\n * Lastly, help others through the same journey as I am taking and hopefully pass on some knowledge. \n\n \r\r  Check out my blog section for all of my articles. You can use the search bar if you're looking for something specific. \n\n " ,

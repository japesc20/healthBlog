  // "The background in fitness and health definitely isn't exciting nor is it short, the road was long and rough among many other things. I began after highschool in 2008, I asked my best friend who was a lifting stud to show me... literally anything. We ended up lifting together for another year and half, with a lot of knowledge gained and eventually to find out a shoulder injury later. I did something very much out of character, I joined the Marine Corps",

    description: "### Welcome Everyone! \n\n Welcome to my health and fitness blog where I'll track my progress back into a healthier lifestyle. Through this I will be hoping for only a few things: \n\n * Keep myself accountable to stay on the healthier path. \n\n * Gain knowledge through trial and error, and find what best suits me with my genetics and lifestyle. \n\n * Lastly, help others through the same journey as I am taking and hopefully pass on some knowledge. \n\n \r\r  Check out my blog section for all of my articles. You can use the search bar if you're looking for something specific. \n\n " ,
